# Tech Quiz Test Suite

## Overview
This project is a full-stack Tech Quiz Application built using the MERN stack.

Users can take a quiz composed of 10 random tech-related questions and receive a final score upon completion.

The primary goal of this enhancement is to integrate Cypress testing into the React-based frontend to ensure the app's reliability and robustness through both component testing (React components) and end-to-end testing (user flows across the full stack).

## Features:

The Tech Quiz App provides an interactive quiz experience with the following functionality:

    ‚úÖ Start Quiz:
    Users can begin the quiz by clicking the Start button on the homepage.

    üß† Dynamic Question Flow:
    After starting, users are presented with one question at a time, randomly selected from a pool of tech-related questions.

    ‚è≠Ô∏è Sequential Questioning:
    Upon selecting an answer, the next question is automatically displayed, continuing until all 10 questions have been answered.

    üèÅ Completion & Scoring:
    Once all questions are answered, users are shown a final score summarizing their performance.

    üîÅ Replay Option:
    After completing the quiz, users have the option to start a new quiz and try again with a fresh set of questions.

## Technologies Used:

    MongoDB for data storage

    Express.js and Node.js for the backend API

    React for the frontend user interface
